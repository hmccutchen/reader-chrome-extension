# Reader Focus

Reader Focus narrows your reading area by dimming the page above and below your cursor, creating a focused window for easier on‑screen reading. You can adjust the shader size to match your comfort and screen layout.

## Using the floating toolbar

1. Click the extension icon to open the popup.
2. Toggle `ON` to show the floating toolbar on the current page.
3. Use the toolbar buttons:
   - `Spotlight`: a circular focus area around your cursor.
   - `Shades`: a horizontal focus window with top/bottom dimming.
   - `Size +` / `Size -`: increase or decrease the focus area size for either mode.
   - `Hide`: temporarily hide the toolbar (use the popup Show/Hide button to bring it back).
   - `Off`: turn off any active mode.
4. Toggle `OFF` in the popup to remove the toolbar entirely.

Default shortcuts (suggested):

- Open focus mode: `Ctrl + Shift + A`
- Close focus mode: `Ctrl + Shift + X`
- Increase shader size: `Ctrl + Shift + ↑`
- Decrease shader size: `Ctrl + Shift + ↓`

## Setting up keyboard shortcuts

The suggested shortcuts above may not be active by default. Most browsers require you to enable or customize extension shortcuts manually.

Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Vivaldi, Opera):
1. Open `chrome://extensions/shortcuts` in the address bar.
2. Find "Reader focus".
3. Assign shortcuts for `open`, `close`, `increase`, and `decrease`.
4. Pick "Global" if you want the shortcuts to work outside the browser (if your browser supports that).

Firefox:
1. Open `about:addons`.
2. Click the gear icon and choose "Manage Extension Shortcuts" (or go to `about:addons` > Extensions > Manage Extension Shortcuts).
3. Find "Reader focus" and set the shortcuts you want.
